	<h2>History of Video Gaming</h2>
	
	<p>
	Most gamers today are using consoles, PC's and Arcades. But in 1947 after of World War II they are using interactive<br>
	electronic devices and mostly they are using CRT monitors (mostly on Televisions). In universities in that time,<br>

	<h3>Early video games in 1950's-60's</h3>
	
	<p>
	The early games in history is "OXO" in 1952, "Tennis for two" in 1958, and "Spacewar!" in 1961.<br>
	In 1961, a group of students at MIT, including Steve Russell,<br>
	programmed a game titled Spacewar! on the PDP-1, a new computer at the time.<br>
	The game pitted two human players against each other, each controlling a spacecraft capable of firing missiles,<br>
	while a star in the center of the screen created a large hazard for the crafts.<br>
	The game was eventually distributed with new DEC computers and traded throughout the then-primitive Internet.<br>
	Spacewar! is credited as the first influential computer game.<br>
	Also in 1961, John Burgeson wrote the first computer baseball simulation game on an IBM 1620 Computer at the IBM facility in Akron, Ohio.<br>
	Users picked a lineup and could then watch the results of their simulated game printed out by the computer.<br>

	<h3>First ever arcade video games (Amusements) in 1970's</h3>
	
	<p>
	In September 1971; Galaxy Game was used at Stanford University. Based on Spacewar!, this was the first coin-operated video game.<br>
	Only one was built, using a DEC PDP-11 and vector display terminals. In 1972 it was expanded to be able to handle four to eight consoles.
	Also in 1971, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney created a coin-operated arcade version of Spacewar! and called it Computer Space.
	Nutting Associates bought the game and manufactured 1,500 Computer Space machines, with the release taking place in November 1971.<br><br>
	The game was unsuccessful due to its steep learning curve, but was a landmark as the first mass-produced video game and the first offered for commercial sale.
	Bushnell and Dabney founded Atari, Inc. in 1972, before releasing their next game: Pong. Pong was the first arcade video game with widespread success.
	The game is loosely based on table tennis: a ball is "served" from the center of the court and as the ball moves towards their side of the court each player must maneuver their paddle to hit the ball back to their opponent. Atari sold over 19,000 Pong machines, creating many imitators.
