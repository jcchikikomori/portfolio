    Established on late 2011 when the HTML and Web became a thing since Friendster<br />
    times (Popular Social Site until Facebook). Started from tutorials provided over<br />
    the net.

    The site was up at jccworld.*****.net before (now is down)<br />
    The content was not the real thing though, but i've learned a lot<br />
    in Web Development and getting hang with it.
